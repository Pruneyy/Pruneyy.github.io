                            My desire to study Petroleum Engineering stems from a passion in physics, engineering and 
                            a thirst for understanding how things work. My natural curiosity enables me to be a quick 
                            learner and effective communicator when it comes to the things I enjoy. I am particularly adept 
                            in learning new technologies and take joy in sharing this knowledge with others. I am a high performing 
                            student achieving distinction marks in key subjects pertinent to my degree such as Petrophysics, Reservoir 
                            Engineering A and Natural Gas Engineering. Along with my study of Computer Science, I believe my skillset
                            allows me to fit in and easily adapt to any working environment.

                        My desire to study Computer Science stems from a passion in understanding the logic behind
                        how systems work. Coupled with University courses, my interest in coding has led to me
                        putting in discretionary time to learn new skills and different coding languages such as C, Java
                        and Python. My interest in User Experience has also allowed me to pick up mark-up text
                        languages such as HTML, and CSS. My studies have steered me towards Databases, particularly SQL,
                        but I also hold a keen interest in Cyber Security and Robotics.
