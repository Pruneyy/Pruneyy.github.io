                        <p>
                            My career plan when I was young was to be a Fireman. I think it was the cool red uniform. As I grew up and matured, I discovered my love for building and fixing.
                            This was refined over years of highschool, into a career in Engineering. There are, however, scores of different types of engineering. This is where my sister came in. 
                            She is a Geologist, which ended up influencing me and led me down the path of Petroleum Engineering at the University of New South Wales. </br>
                            I started this four year degree in 2013 but by 2015 my career decision was wavering. I enjoyed Petroleum Engineering, and would love to work in the industry, 
                            however with the volatility of the oil and gas market, job prospects were looking grim, and lo and behold, only 1 person in my entire cohort managed to get a job 
                            in the industry after graduation. Now, my biggest hobby is playing video games, and the more I played them, the more intrigued I became with the inner workings of them. 
                            The whole "hand in quest, get reward" system also grew on me. This put me on the path of my second degree: Computer Science. </br>
                            At this point, it was nearing the end of 2015/start of 2016, so I decided to finish off the last year of my Petroleum Engineering degree and turn my
                            degree into a double degree with Engineering and Computer Science. As I did more and more Computer Science courses, I got stuck choosing between 3 majors:
                            Security, AI or Databases. AI proved to have too many prerequisites for me to enter, which left Security and Databases. I went with Databases due to a slight preference
                            towards the handling of large amounts of data. I am now set to finish my double degree by the 18th of May 2019 and am looking to work in both the IT and Oil & Gas industries.

                        <p> 
                            Note: All of this information can be found, nicely summarised, in my résumé. </br></br>
                            My work life has always been quite rocky. I started off with tutoring when I first entered University. I quickly realised how unprepared I was
                            for such a task so soon after high school. After half a year of tutoring, I stopped. Since then, although not an official job, I have managed
                            to assist friends and students at University, which I believe shows how much I've grown and matured and become better at teaching. </br>
                            I was then lucky enough to get 2 weeks of work experience at the company my sister works for: Woodside. These two weeks were mainly data entry, but I was still exposed to a 9-5 style work life
                            which proved to be a valuable experience at such an early stage of my degree. </br>
                            I had a stint working Nightfill at Woolworths in my home town of Cherrybrook. After just over a year working this job, my family and I moved houses. 
                            This meant leaving the wonderful job that tied in perfectly with my University life. </br>
                            I then managed to obtain an internship at Caltex in the Sydney CBD. I did 3 months of work at this job which was all covered in great detail in my internship
                            report that had to be submitted to the University to get my degree approved. A very basic summary is: I worked in a pretty tight knit team on some
                            major projects going on at the company, the details of which cannot be disclosed for confidentiality reasons. At the end of my internship, I was allowed to 
                            rotate through their Security IT department to gain experience with my Computer Science degree and help me decide on a major. </br>
                            My current ongoing job is with a small company called Macromeasures. Our motto is "We build beautiful systems. This is our passion". This is a pretty
                            accurate representation of what we do. We build systems and solutions for clients as needed. Our current project involves updating a companies database 
                            to be more easily accessible and creating a better UI front page for the employees to get their work done more efficiently. It was requested that we use 
                            Angular and Node to do this. </br>
                            Now I am here, building up a portfolio, applying to hundreds of jobs looking for that permanent full time role that will dictate
                            the majority of my life.
                        </p>
                        <li class=input-header>Hobbies</li>
                        <p> 
                            I have had two core hobbies over my entire life, well at least as far back as I can remember. And those are video games and reading. Both these hobbies
                            are pretty self explanatory, and quite common in this day and age, so there's nothing to really expand on here. Just know that these hobbies started 
                            very early and will continue until the day I die. </br>
                            Over the years, I did develop a few other hobbies that are on and off sought of things. I went through almost a decade of Scouts which gave me a drive
                            to find and fix things. I even built my own shoddy basketball hoop in my backyard using an old crate, a lot of wood, nails, ducktape and string. </br>
                            Sports was another big one. Starting with Little Athletics, going into over 5 years of Soccer and over 10 years of Cricket. This hobby continued at a non
                            competitive level as I hit University where I played a range of sports socially with my friends. </br>
                            The final hobby that I can remember is crocheting. This is the one that is still currently going on, but will likely die and come back later on in my life.
                            This stemmed from my desire to build, create and fix things but was truly accelerated through influences from my sister who crochets as her hobby. </br>
                            All of these hobbies have in one way or another, shaped my strengths and weaknesses. Some of them also served to compliment each other, for example, 
                            growing up reading and playing video games caused me to be more quiet and reserved throughout highshool. However, playing sports and attending Scouts
                            allowed me to grow and become more of a people person.
